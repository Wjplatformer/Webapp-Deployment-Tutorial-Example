# Finesse
A note taking webapp from a tutorial by @techwithtim. Built using React and Django.<br>
### Improvements:
- Added a delete user view and system
- Custom alert messages
- Completed with Bruno Mars's `Finesse` playing in the background

### Django
Starting a project: `django-admin startproject [foldername]`<br>
making apps : `py [filename] startapp [name]`<br>

migrate files to db `py [filename] migrate`

tip: keep auth paths seperate from user paths etc
